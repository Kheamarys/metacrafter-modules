# MyToken README

## Introduction
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named `MyToken`. This contract implements a basic ERC20 token with functionalities such as minting and burning tokens. Below are the details of the functionalities and how to use them.

## Requirements
The contract fulfills the following requirements:

1. The contract contains public variables that store the details about the coin:
   - Token Name (`name`)
   - Token Abbreviation (`symbol`)
   - Total Supply (`totalSupply`)

2. The contract has a mapping of addresses to balances (`balances`), which allows keeping track of the token balances for each address.

3. The contract has a `mint` function that takes two parameters: an address (`_recipient`) and a value (`_value`). This function increases the total supply by `_value` and increases the balance of the `sender` address by that amount.

4. The contract has a `burn` function, which works opposite to the `mint` function. It takes an address (`_owner`) and a value (`_value`). It deducts the value from the total supply and from the balance of the `sender`.

5. The `burn` function has conditionals to ensure that the balance of the `sender` is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

## Usage

### Deployment

To deploy this contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract using a Solidity compatible platform or an Ethereum development environment like Remix.
2. Provide the following parameters during deployment:
   - `_name`: The name of the token.
   - `_symbol`: The abbreviation of the token.
   - `_initialSupply`: The initial total supply of the token.

### Minting Tokens

To mint new tokens, call the `mint` function with the following parameters:

- `_recipient`: The address to which the new tokens will be minted.
- `_value`: The amount of tokens to be minted.

### Burning Tokens

To burn existing tokens, call the `burn` function with the following parameters:

- `_owner`: The address of the token holder who wants to burn tokens.
- `_value`: The amount of tokens to be burned.
